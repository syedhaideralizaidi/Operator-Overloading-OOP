# Operator-Overloading-OOP
These are some of the questions regarding Operator overloading in Object Oriented Programming.

Q 1: Operator overloading for Fraction Class - Develop a class named Fraction. This class handles fractionâ€™s
numerator and denumerator. It should include three constructors. One with no parameters and which creates the
fraction 0/1, one with one parameter numer and which creates the fraction numer/1, and one with two parameters
and which creates the fraction numer/denom, but which assures that the fraction will be in normalized form (that
is, positive denominator and with the greatest common divisor removed from the numerator and denominator).
Make sure that the store method also stores fractions in normalized form. The class should also have copy
constructor. Add three public methods (functions) to the class, called getNumerator, getDenominator, and display
that return the values of the numerator, denominator of the fraction and display fraction. The class fraction should
be able to overload operators which includes, +,-,*,/,+=,-=,*=,/=,<<,>>,==,!=,<,>,>=,<=,[],++,--,(),&&,||,&,->, ->* The
header file and implementation files should be separate files.
Please also write down the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we will be running your
code against our test code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.

Q 2: Operator Overloading for String Class - Your goal is to overload the operators for String class that you have
implemented in the last assignment. You will need to write three files (string.h, string.cpp and stringMain.cpp). Your
implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write down
the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test code
and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.

Q 3: Operator Overloading for Matrix Class - Your goal is to overload the operators for Matrix class that you have
implemented in the last assignment. You will need to write three files (matrix.h, matrix.cpp and matrixMain.cpp).
Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write
down the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our
test code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.

Q 4: Operator Overloading for Polynomial Class - Your goal is to overload the operators for a generic Polynomial
class. A polynomial will be represented via its coefficients. Here is a degree of third degree polynomial 4x3+ 3x + 2;
here will be four coefficients and the coefficient corresponding to 2nd power is zero. You will need to write three
files (polynomial.h, polynomial.cpp and polynomialMain.cpp). Your implemented class must fully provide the
definitions of following class (interface) functions. Please also write down the test code to drive your class
implementation. Please note that we will be running your code against our test code and any segmentation faults
or incorrect result will result in loss of marks.

Q 5: Operator Overloading for Array Class - Your goal is to overload the operators for Array class. You will need to
write three files (array.h, array.cpp and arrayMain.cpp). Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions
of following class (interface) functions. Please also write down the test code to drive your class implementation.
Please note that we will be running your code against our test code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result
will result in loss of marks.[document.pdf](https://github.com/zaidi-14/Operator-Overloading-OOP/files/6161543/document.pdf)
